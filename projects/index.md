You can find me on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/winniehell/) and on
[github](https://www.github.com/winniehell/) (where I also host this homepage)
but most of my projects are in early progress and therefore only on my computer.

Note also that most of my projects are not under active development as I don't
have enough time to run them alone, neither do I know any interested people who
are willing to join&mdash;if you are, please do not hesitate to
[contact me](/contact/).
