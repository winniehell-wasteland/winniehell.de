title: about me
---
I'm a software developer from Germany &mdash; currently employed in automotive
industry. My interest in computer science is grounded in starting to program at
the age of 11 &mdash; though I have learned at university that computer science
is much more than just programming. You can see some of my projects
[here](/projects/).

In my spare time, I enjoy any of the following: Learning languages (though I
often fail at remembering the vocabulary), taking photos (some of them you can
see in my [gallery](/gallery/)), ballroom dancing (which I did regularly for six
years), making music, or playing board and card games with my friends.
