title: about me
---
I'm a software developer from Germany&mdash;currently employed in automotive
industry. My interest in computer science is grounded in starting to program at
highschool&mdash;though I have learned since then that computer science
is much more than just programming. You can see some of my projects
[here](/projects/).

In my spare time, I enjoy any of the following: Playing with my daughter, taking photos
(some of them you can see in my [gallery](/gallery/)), ballroom dancing (which I do for 
more than six years now), or playing board and card games with my friends.
