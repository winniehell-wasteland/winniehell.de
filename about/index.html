title: About me

---
			<p>I am a computer science student from Germany in the second last
			semester of my master's degree. My interest in computer science is
			grounded in starting to program at the age of 11 &mdash; though I have
			learned that computer science is much more than just programming. You can
			see some of my projects <a href="projects.html">here</a></p>
			
			<p>Additionally, I am interested in learning languages, even though I
			often fail at remembering the vocabulary. In school, I have learned
			French and Latin (and English obviously), but until now I forgot most of
			it. Nevertheless, I am learning Spanish at university now.</p>
			
			<p>Furthermore, I like taking photos. Some of them you can see in my
			<a href="gallery/">gallery</a>. Since six years I go ballroom dancing at
			least once a week. At times, I draw, play the guitar or
			write poems. I also like to play board and card games with my friends or
			my family.</p>
